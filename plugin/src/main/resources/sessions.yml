# Sessions configuration
#
# You can create has many session as you want.
# It defines a time window where /ea tp <session-name> teleports you to the configured server
#
# Each section should respect this format:
#
#<session-name>:
#  destination: <destination>
#  duration: <duration>
#  player-by-iteration: <playerByIteration>
#  period: <period>
#  server-down: <serverDown>
#  cant-connect: <cantConnect>
#  already-connected: <alreadyConnected>
#  already-in-queue: <alreadyInQueue>
#  not-opened: <notOpened>
#  success: <success>
#
# Where:
# <session-name> is the name of the session used in sequences.yml
# <destination> is the name of the destination server
# <duration> is the duration before this session closes itself in millisecond
# <playerByIteration> is the number of player teleported each iteration of the queue
# <period> is the duration between two iteration of the teleport task
# <serverDown> is the message sent when the server is down
# <cantConnect> is the message sent when the player can't connect to the server
# <alreadyConnected> is the message sent when the player is already connected
# <alreadyInQueue> is the message sent when the player is already in queue
# <notOpened> is the message sent when the session is not opened
# <success> is the message when the player successfully join the teleport queue
#
# For example:
#
#example:
#  destination: skyblock
#  duration: 10000
#  player-by-iteration: 5
#  period: 100
#  server-down: "&cThe server is down"
#  cant-connect: "&cYou can't join this server"
#  already-connected: "&cYou are already connected"
#  already-in-queue: "&cYou are already in the queue to join the server"
#  not-opened: "&cYou can't use the teleporter right now"
#  success: "&aYou will be teleported to the skyblock server"
#
#
# This will create a session where the maximum amount of player teleported is 5 players every 100ms
