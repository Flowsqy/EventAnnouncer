# Sequence configuration
#
# You can define as many sequence as you want
# It should respect this format:
#
#<sequence-name>:
#  <step-name>:
#    delay: <delay>
#    message:
#      id: <message-id>
#      servers: <servers>
#    title:
#      title: <title>
#      subtitle: <subtitle>
#      stay: <stay>
#      fade-in: <fade-in>
#      fade-out: <fade-out>
#      servers: <servers>
#    actionbar:
#      id: <actionbar-id>
#      servers: <servers>
#
# Where:
# <sequence-name> is the name of the sequence
# <step-name> is the name of the step. Note that this name is not used and only exist to differentiate each steps
# <delay> is the delay between the previous step and this one in millisecond
# <servers> is the list of servers where the information will be sent
# <message-id> is the message that will be sent. It should be a valid id defined in message-registry.lang
# <title> is the title that will be sent. It should be a valid id defined in message-registry.lang
# <subtitle> is the subtitle that will be sent. It should be a valid id defined in message-registry.lang
# <stay> is how long the title will stay in ticks. (1 second = 20 ticks)
# <fade-in> is how long the title will fade in, in ticks
# <fade-out> is how long the title will fade out, in ticks
# <actionbar-id> is the action bar message that will be sent. It should be a valid id defined in message-registry.lang
#
#
# For example, assuming example1, example2, example3 are valid id defined in message-registry.lang
#
#example:
#  step1: 
#    delay: 1000
#    message:
#      id: example1
#      servers:
#        - lobby
#        - survival
#    title:
#      title: example2
#      stay: 20
#      servers:
#        - lobby
#  step2:
#    delay: 3000
#    actionbar:
#      id: example3
#      servers:
#        - lobby
